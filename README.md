# Sunlit-Garden
My personal React based dashboard. It is still a work in progress.

## Behind the Name
[Tokyo Ghoul](http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Sunlit_Garden)

## Motivation
I just wanted to make a dashboard. I examined other dashboard builders which 
either had limitations or pricing barriers. I looked at other dashboard builders
and they seemed too advanced for my desires. 

I built this to mess around with Stock Prices API primarily and wanted
a way to perhaps centralize IoT data collected from various sources.

## Features
- [x] Current Day Stock Price Query
- [x] Stock Price Graph
- [x] Persist Tracking Stock Symbols
- [x] Private Group Messaging 
  - [ ] Auth users
  - [ ] Index Links shared ?
  - [ ] Index Image shared (via Tags?)
- [ ] Filtered Aggregate News Feed ?
- [ ] Classic Calendar + Weather ?

## Q&A
### Q: Is this under active development?
A: Sort of. I am working on it as I come up with interesting features 
that I might find useful and interesting to poke at. This is all
done in my spare time.

### Q: Can you add feature `x`?
A: Maybe. I am working on this project in my spare time. If the feature is
well described in an issue and I have practical use for it, I may try. But
a pull request is always welcomed ðŸ˜€.
